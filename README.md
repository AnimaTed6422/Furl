# Furl

Furl is a Filesharing web app written without a database, using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Why?

I wanted to make Furl because there are a few problems with Filesharing websites

1. Accounts; I hate signing up for new services.
2. Cloud Drives; I don't need to store all of my files on the cloud.
3. Plans; Who wants to pay for cloud storage.

So I made Furl.

## How?

As assubed to before, It doesn't use a database. It takes the files content and furls it up into a url, then spits it out so you can use it.

I am currently looking into compression to allow bigger files to be uploaded.

## Limitations

- Only Text works; I have been working valiantly on getting binary files to work, but haven't yet.
- Must be ~3KB or less, according to my math.
